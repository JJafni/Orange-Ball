# Orange-Ball

# Description

In this game, you are a white paddle at the left-side of the screen, and your goal is to deflect an orange ball back to the green wall at the top of the screen to earn points.

# Controls

- Use the left and right arrow keys to move the blue paddle left and right.
- Use the space bar to deflect the orange ball back to the green wall.

# Scoring

- Each time you deflect the orange ball back to the green wall, you will earn one point.
- If the orange ball hits the blue paddle or the bottom of the screen, you will lose one point.
- The game ends when you reach a score of 10 points or when you lose all of your points.

# Tips

- Try to predict where the orange ball will bounce off the green wall, and position the blue paddle accordingly.
- Pay attention to the speed and angle of the orange ball, and adjust the timing and direction of your deflection accordingly.
- If the orange ball is moving too fast or too erratically, you can use the space bar to slow it down or change its direction.
