# Orange-Ball

# Description
In this game, you are a blue paddle at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to deflect an orange ball back to the green wall at the top of the screen to earn points.

# Controls
Use the left and right arrow keys to move the blue paddle left and right.
Use the space bar to deflect the orange ball back to the green wall.

# Scoring
Each time you deflect the orange ball back to the green wall, you will earn one point.
If the orange ball hits the blue paddle or the bottom of the screen, you will lose one point.
The game ends when you reach a score of 10 points or when you lose all of your points.

# Tips
Try to predict where the orange ball will bounce off the green wall, and position the blue paddle accordingly.
Pay attention to the speed and angle of the orange ball, and adjust the timing and direction of your deflection accordingly.
If the orange ball is moving too fast or too erratically, you can use the space bar to slow it down or change its direction.
